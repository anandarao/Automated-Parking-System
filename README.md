# Automated Parking System
Simple Automated Parking System using Multisim

Automation is a key point in the process of development. Space management and timekeeping has been an issue for so many years especially in and around us because the technology is still at a low level among people, but as the world continues to develop in every sector of activity, this is the reason why we have chosen to design an AUTOMATED PARKING SYSTEM.

This system will allow people who are meant to be drivers in this project to park their vehicles in any parking provided and disable the drivers not to park; by opening and closing the gate automatically due to the number of vehicles present in the parking. This system also calculates the amount to be paid while leaving.

## Requirements :
